# Life Visualization
I saw https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/jedddq/each_square_represents_one_week_of_an_88_year/ on Reddit and decided to throw together a software version since I myself am turning 20 soon (as of the time I'm making this).

I made lifeExpectancy and dateOfBirth query parameters where lifeExpectancy is an integer and dateOfBirth is a string in the format dd-mm-yyyy.
